                 "EVENING ANNIVERSARY MESSAGE — FRESH, LOVABLE, DEEPLY MISSING

                My baby… good evening.
                This night carried your name in the breeze, and somehow it reminded me of everything I haven’t said yet.
                
                Happy Anniversary, my love.
                
                There’s a kind of silence that only you can break—
                and every evening without you reminds me just how loud missing you is.
                I don’t just think about you… I feel you.
                In the empty spaces.
                In the pauses between my breaths.
                In the small moments when the world slows down and your face is the only thing my mind returns to.

                
                I miss you every single day, Chineke’m.
                Not the loud kind of missing…
                but the soft, steady kind—
                like a heartbeat calling for its echo.
                
                You’ve filled my life with a sweetness I didn’t know I needed.
                You gave me peace without asking for anything back.
                You gave me light in places I didn’t even realize were dim.
                And every night, especially nights like this—
                I wish I could hold you,
                feel your warmth on my chest,
                hear your laugh right beside my ear…
                instead of imagining it from miles away.
                
                Tonight, I just want you to know this:
                
                If love is a journey, then you are the part of it that makes the road worth walking.
                If time is a river, then you are the reason I never fight the current.
                
                Thank you for loving me in ways I never expected but always prayed for.
                Thank you for choosing me every day, even from afar.
                
                I can’t wait to see you.
                To touch you.
                To finally close this distance that has overstayed its welcome.
                
                Until then—
                just know that I carry you in every hour,
                in every thought,
                in every quiet part of my night.
                
                Good evening, my Nkem.
                Happy Anniversary once more.
                I miss you… every day.
                And I love you even more than that.
                
                🖤✨"</p>
